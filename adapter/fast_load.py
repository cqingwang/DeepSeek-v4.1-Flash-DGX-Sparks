"""Faster checkpoint loading without changing the bytes that reach the model.

Measured on the 4x Spark TP4/EP2 fleet (2026-09-17): the target load_weight took 230-290 s while
every rank copied only ~130 GB of the 510 GB checkpoint. The stock loader hands the model
mmap-backed safetensors tensors, and the 24-thread copy pool page-faults them in 4-128 KB pieces
(0.5 GB/s on the ranks with moe_tp_rank 0, ~2 GB/s on the others) while the same NVMe delivers
5-6 GB/s to threaded ``pread``. Warming the page cache ahead of the copies does not survive on
GB10: GPU memory is system memory, so the cache is squeezed while the weights land and the
warmed pages are evicted before the copy touches them. ``posix_fadvise(WILLNEED)`` is capped at
the 128 KB readahead window anyway.

What this does, gated by ``DSV41_FAST_LOAD=1``:

1. When the loader opens a shard, the tensors *this rank* will copy are read eagerly into
   pinned host memory (torch's caching host allocator; anonymous mmaps without CUDA) by a
   16-thread ``pread`` pool (every tensor except the routed experts
   another EP rank owns and the Engram tables, which the row store serves straight from NVMe).
   ``get_tensor`` for those names returns the resident tensor; everything else stays the stock
   mmap tensor. Same file offsets, same dtype, same shape: the values are identical by
   construction and a wrong ownership guess only costs I/O.
2. The model's ``load_weights`` submits every copy to a thread pool and never waits, so the
   shard enumeration would run far ahead and keep whole shards resident. ``maybe_executor_submit``
   is wrapped with a byte budget (``DSV41_FAST_LOAD_INFLIGHT_GB``, default 6): the enumeration,
   and with it the loader's window and the eager reads, stays just ahead of the copies. A copy
   whose source is a view into a slab charges the whole slab, once, until the last queued copy
   from that slab finishes (one slow small copy keeps its whole slab alive); other sources charge
   their own bytes. Host memory in flight is bounded by that budget plus one slab plus the loader
   window (``--model-loader-extra-config {"num_threads":1}`` = 2 shards, ~3.4 GB each on TP4/EP2).
3. The DSpark draft is loaded from the same 48 shards but consumes only ``mtp.*`` tensors (see
   ``_remap_dspark_weight_name``). During that load, shards without any ``mtp.*`` key are handed
   back empty so the loader does not open and enumerate 45 files for nothing.
4. Expert tensor parallelism (``moe_ep_size == 1``, ``moe_tp_size > 1``; knob
   ``DSV41_FAST_LOAD_TP_SLICE``, default ``auto``): every rank needs a 1/moe_tp slice of every
   routed expert, so a routed ``w1``/``w3`` (weight and scale) is read as the rank's contiguous row
   block and a ``w2`` as whole rows (every 4 KB page holds needed bytes, so the device reads it all
   anyway) from which a per-thread bounce buffer keeps the rank's columns. ``get_tensor`` returns a
   full-shape stand-in (``_tp_slice_cls``) whose ``narrow`` along the sliced dim returns the resident
   slice; any other access raises. EP2 is untouched unless ``DSV41_FAST_LOAD_TP_SLICE=1``.
5. Slabs (``DSV41_FAST_LOAD_SLAB_MB``, default 256; 0 = one pinned buffer per tensor as before):
   a shard's eager tensors are packed, in the order the loader yields them (sorted names), into
   power-of-two pinned slabs, and every tensor is a view into its slab. Tensors larger than a
   slab get their own buffer. Full slabs share one size bin of torch's caching host allocator, so
   a freed slab is reused by the next shard: a load makes tens of ``cudaHostAlloc`` calls instead
   of thousands (EP1 used to request 92k small pinned blocks, each rounded up to a power of two).
   A slab goes back to the allocator when the last view into it dies; ``_release_all`` checks with
   storage weak references that none is still alive (an escaped view would pin a whole slab) and
   names the tensors if one is. After the target load an escaped slab is an error (it would sit in
   the KV pool's budget); after the draft load it is a warning. ``DSV41_FAST_LOAD_MEMLOG=1`` logs
   the host-memory counters, the GPU processes and the pinned-allocation counts at each phase end.

Everything is released before the KV pool is sized, so the head's memory budget is unchanged.
